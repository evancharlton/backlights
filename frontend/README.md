# Aurora frontend

This is the web frontend for the backlights. It relies on Firebase to do the
communication with the MCU -- if you use a different firebase project then
you'll have to drop in a different configuration.

## Running

To run this locally, do:

```sh
yarn # install
yarn start
```

## Deployment

Do the firebase deployment from inside of this folder.

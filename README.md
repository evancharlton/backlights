# Aurora

A fun little project to give over-engineer some backlights for my monitor. At
its core, it's a NodeMCU with some LEDs connected, which is connected to a
Firebase database. This is then controlled with a React-based web UI.

See the [firmware](./firmware) and [frontend](./frontend) folders for more
information.

## In action

Since only I can see it in action, here's some pictures to show it off. The
pictures were taken in darker-than-normal settings, so the effect is a bit
more exaggerated than it would normally be seen, but hey.

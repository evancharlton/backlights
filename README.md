# Aurora

A fun little project to give over-engineer some backlights for my monitor. At
its core, it's a NodeMCU with some LEDs connected, which is connected to a
Firebase database. This is then controlled with a React-based web UI.

See the [firmware](./firmware) and [frontend](./frontend) folders for more
information.
